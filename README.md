- 👋 Hi, I’m Robin 
     
     Story behind the name @bangerang-rob:
     BANGERANG, which is acutally just a referenace to the lost boys from the movie hook.
     Apart from it being a super badass movie with one of the top actors ever lived (who btw is my namesake),
     it's the Jamaican word for “chaos”. With years of work experience in operations, I thaught it fits quite good. 😎 

- 👀 I’m interested in data, good food and conversations about Harry Potter.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, R and SQL
